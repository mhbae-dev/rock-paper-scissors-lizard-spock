## Introduction

This is a expansion on the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. A tribute to the creators Sam Kass and Karen Bryla and The Big Bang Theory.

As Sheldon explains in the series the rules are as follows :

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors
